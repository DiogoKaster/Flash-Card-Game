# Flash Card Game
>My python version of the Flash Card Game.

## Objective
It's a guess game where you test your French memory with the 100 most used
word. A random English word will appear and after 3 seconds it'll show
the French version of it. Your objective is to try to remember how this
specific English word is in French. Finally, you can click in the right or
the wrong button to track your guesses.
